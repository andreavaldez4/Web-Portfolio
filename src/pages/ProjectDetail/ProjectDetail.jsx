      "convert text into Braille and generate STL files for 3D printing, enabling accessible educational materials for visually impaired students.",
    image: edumakers_logo,
    fullDescription:
      "Developed a Python-based software that converts text into Braille-ready STL files for 3D printing, enhancing accessibility in education. The project involved implementing data processing algorithms, automating STL generation using NumPy-STL and Pandas, and designing a modular system for custom Braille plates. Additionally, I contributed to database structuring for 3D representations of Braille characters, integrated Blender scripting for text extrusion, and provided comprehensive user documentation. Inspired by collaboration with Wake Forest University, this initiative aligns with assistive technology advancements to improve educational inclusivity.",
